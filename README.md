# Power-BI-Reports

### Project Title: Adventure Works

### Project Description

- In this project I had the opportunity to work with Adventure Works dataset. Adventure Works is a bike manufacturer and seller.
- The project involves creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze various aspects of the business, including sales, revenue, profit, customer behavior, product performance, and returns.
- The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights to support decision-making processes.

#### Loading Data

I imported raw data in form of .cvs format and loaded it directly in the PowerBI. A total of 8 files were imported, each occupying their own table.

#### Data Cleaning

After loading the data into Power BI, I performed the follwoing data cleaning steps:
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Standardized data formats


#### Data Modelling

After loading and cleaning up the data, I created data models by establishing relationships among the tables. One-to-many relationships
  were very prevalent among the tables, such as:
  - **Customers to Sales**: One customer can have many sale transactions.
  - **Products to Sales**: One product can appear in many sales transactions.
  - **Sales to Returns**: One sales transaction can have multiple returns.
    
 Below is a screenshot of my model view.
