# Power-BI-Reports

### Project Title: Adventure Works

### Project Description
- In this project I had the opportunity to work with Adventure Works dataset. Adventure Works is a bike manufacturer and seller.
- The project involves creating a Power BI dashboard to analyze various aspects of the business, including sales, revenue, profit, customer behavior, product performance, and returns.
- The dashboard aims to provide actionable insights to support decision-making processes.

#### Loading Data
- I imported raw data in form of .cvs format and loaded it directly in the PowerBI. A total of 8 files were imported, each occupying their own table.

#### Data Cleaning
- The project begun with cleaning the data which involved dealing with missing values, formatting the column titles and data types to ensure data accuracy and consistency,
   and identifying relationships between the tables.

#### Data Modelling
- After loading and cleaning up the data, I began by creating data models through establishing relationships among the  tables.
- I identified that *one-to-many* relationships was very prevalent among the tables. Here is a screensho of the data model that I created.
